            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
				
			<b>Basic RP Rules:</b>
                    <li>Do not RDM under any circumstances. You must have a valid reason to kill such as self defence, trespassing or </li>
					<li>Follow your job rules.</li>
                    <li>Do not self supply. This means you cannot change to a shop class, spawn shipments and change back to your previous job straight after.</li>
                    <li>Do not metagame. This means you must pretend you don't know a hitman is a hitman.
						<ul>
							<li>Your gang is seen as a gang while you are breaking the law. This means that if your blood leader kills someone, the police can arrest a normal blood aswell.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>You are ALWAYS in character. You cannot be an OOC job.</li>
					<li>Use the <em>/OOC</em> properly. It is the only time you can speak out of character. Do not taunt in OOC.</li>
					<li>Use <em>/cr</em> to report crimes to the police.</li>
                    <li>Government jobs are only allowed to own a printer if it's in a bank.(Banker job).
						<ul>
							<li>This is considered corrupt and the banker could get you arrested, or you could pay a bit extra ;) </li>
						</ul><br>
			<b>Weapons and Combat:</b>
                    <li>You must mark a KOS area clearly. Otherwise a clear verbal/chat warning must be given before the player is killed. </li>
					<li>You can be instantly cuffed/searched/weapons confiscated/arrested if you are seen by the Government carrying any firearm in public.</li>
                    <li>One handed and melee weapons are legal by default. You can carry (but not wield) them in public.
					<li>Two handed weapons are illegal by default (you cannot carry them at all) unless otherwise stated on the law board.
						<ul>
							<li>A Gun License allows you to legally carry (but not wield) 2 handed weapons in public.</li>
							<li>A Gun License allows you to legally wield 2 handed weapons within your establishment.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Do not put innocent lives at risk (bait cops by walking around with a gun out for no reason) nor act as a meat shield for others.</li>
					<li>Try to minimise bunny hopping during combat.</li><br>
                    
			<b>Stealing:</b>
                    <li>You are only allowed to mug for $1000 or less. Do not repetitively mug a player.</li>
					<li>You MUST advertise muggings. Example: "/advert (MUG) Give me $1000 or I'll kill you!"</li>
                    <li>You cannot steal items which are crucial for someones job, they may be destroyed however.
						<ul>
							<li>These items include meth cookware, cocaine barrels etc.</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>Stealing during an RP transaction is not allowed, regardless of the job you are playing as.
						<ul>
							<li>This includes stealing ammo or other items as someone spawns them.</li>
						</ul></li>
                    <li>For any transaction involving currency, the seller must provide said goods or a refund.</li><br>
							
			<b>AFK and Suicide:</b>					
					<li>Do not AFK for long periods of time as any job other than Citizen or Hobo.</li>
					<li>You are not immune to RP when you are AFK. (You can be pick pocketed, raided, etc.)</li>
					<li>No AFK boxes. (Blocking yourself in so you can't be raided).</li>
					<li>Do not suicide or change job to avoid RP situations.
						<ul>
							<li>We don't care if you suicide with friends for laughs, we're not that serious, just don't break any roleplay.</li>
						</ul>
                </ul>
            </div>
	
            <h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">3. Roleplay Rules</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
			<b>New Life Rule (NLR):</b>
                    <li>If you die in public, you must not return to your point of death for 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>If you die on your property, you may only return early if there is no raid or RP situation ongoing.
						<ul>
							<li>You must wait for any raids to complete before returning.</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>When you die, you forget all details about your past life. You remember nothing, apart from needing to avoid your area of death.
						<ul>
							<li>You are not allowed to rejoin combat or regain memory just because someone from your old life mentions the same issue in your new life.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>A police officer cannot arrest a person that killed them, however if someone is wanted by the police, the officer may attempt to arrest them.
						<ul>
							<li>This goes to say the police officer who died cannot run directly towards the previous death, but may perhaps find the wanted person nearby. Play fairly.</li>
						</ul>
                    <br>		
					
			<b>FearRP:</b>

                    <li>Do not use contraints on your build.
						<ul>
							<li>Only constrain your build when you are ready to save. (Feel free to use Smart Weld)</li>
							<li>When pasting with advanced dupe, ensure that it is "Without Constraints".</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>Players that are building may place a "Building" sign, disallowing people from raiding their base. Please note:

                    <li>Signs are to be used for RP purposes only and may only be placed on or inside the owner's property.
						<ul>
							<li>An RP legitimate protest may spawn signs in public. It's a protest after all!</li>

						</ul><br>

			<b>Base Defences:</b>
					<li>Base entrances must not be excessively difficult (or long) so you can simply camp it from the outside.</li>
                    <li>KOS tunnels must be wide enough for two people in all directions and must not force the raiders to crouch or jump. (Including world areas)</li>

				<br>

							<li>All fading doors must be lockpickable and have an attached keypad/button directly next to the door, on both sides, which is clearly visible.</li>
                            <li>The keypad must stay open for at least 4 seconds once a successful password has been entered.</li>

					<li>You may have 2 extra doors, however these doors can only be triggered by buttons which must be placed directly on the centre or side of the door.</li>
					<li>All elevators and timed doors are considered a locked door. While you can use them, it's strategically far better that you don't.</li>

				<br>
					
			<b>Fading Window Rules:</b>
					<li>Fading windows must be positioned on the same level as the target area. They cannot be on a second story, for example.
						<ul>
							<li>Using any windows (fading or not) on the roof or floor is not permitted.</li>
							<li>Only an open (no fading windows) ledge that overlooks the front of a base is permitted to be out of level with the target area.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Fading windows must stay open for at least 1 second once they are used. (Hold them open manually, toggle, wire timer, etc)
					<li>A fading window must look like a window. Eg: Glass, tinted, fence material, etc. They cannot be opaque or fully transparent.</li>
					<li>Fading props cannot be the same material as its surroundings in an attempt to hide it. This applies to all fading props.</li>
					<li>A fading window prop must be of a height where person's on both sides can see waist to head, whether armed or not.
						<ul>
							<li>This means a minimum window height of '05' when looking at the tooltip measurements of a plate or block.</li>
							<li><i>(You can find these props by searching for '05' in the Q menu)</i></li>
						</ul>
				<br>
				
			<b>Shop Rules:</b>
					<li>Gun stores and other shops must be built within the following guidelines:
						<ul>
							<li>Wiremod automatic bases are permitted as long as you are not always AFK. You still need to roleplay.
							<li>Stores must have a front counter area where trading with customers takes place.
							<li>The shop owner must man the counter and also must be clearly visible to facilitate roleplay.
							<li>Stores without a front counter are not in the best interests of RP and will be removed.</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>The store itself should be primarily defended from inside the base. This means unmanned kiosks are not allowed.</li><br>
				
			<b>Wiremod:</b>
					<li>Using Wiremod entities for anything apart from their intended design is not tolerated.
						<ul>
							<li>A button is to be used as a button, a pixel is to be used as a pixel, etc.
						</ul>
					<li>You are not permitted to actively hide any buttons or keypads in a base which has valuables in it.
						<ul>
							<li>You must not use materials which blend them into the background.
